## Installation
Simply install the package through Composer.

```
composer require axiom/rivescript

## Integration
The RiveScript PHP interpreter is framework agnostic. As such, the interpreter can be used as is with native PHP, or with your favorite framework.

<i>example.rive</a>
```rivescript

+ hello bot
- Hello Human

```

```php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \Axiom\Rivescript\Rivescript;

$message = 'hello bot';
$rivescript = new Rivescript();
$rivescript->load('example.rive');

echo $rivescript->reply($message);

```

<i>Output</i>
```bash
Hello Human
```

## Important: Working Draft

The RiveScript Working Draft (WD) is a document that defines the standards for how RiveScript should work, from an implementation-agnostic point of view. The Working Draft should be followed when contributing to the RiveScript-PHP interpreter. If any of the current implementations don't do what the Working Draft says they should, this is considered to be a bug and you can file a bug report or send a pull request.
